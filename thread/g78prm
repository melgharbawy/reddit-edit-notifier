{"title":"Silk's Road to 144K","body":"So.. After seeing u/chronicklez's post yesterday - I was disappointed to learn that the guy withdrew the last $30 from his account... which I believe was enough, with the right trades, to get get back to even and beyond!  What kind of sick fuck loses all that money, then withdraws the last 30?!  If he needed it for toilet paper, then I'm sorry,  I apologize...\n\nAnyways, I made an additional Robinhood account with my wife's info and deposited $30.  I am going to grind my way up to 144K in the memory of u/chronicklez's account - When I get there, I will give him 5K so he can attempt to get back to even.  If I fail, then I fail - but at least I tried...\n\nI will spend today searching for the right trade... maybe its out there maybe its not... Part of me wants to make it a call on CLX because of what daddy pump said yesterday... but I don't know how i feel about blood money... Don't inject bleach... or stick UV lights up your ass to kill the virus (if you wanna do it for kicks, go for it, maybe your wife's bf will assist, I know mine would love to)... Anyways, when I find the trade, I will post it here, then we will go from there, and hopefully we will get back to 144k together - as one nation under Shkreli... and we will get through this fucking nightmare of a reality that most of us are living and come out the other side stronger and richer and happier... or we won't and none of us will make it out alive and we will all die miserable deaths on ventilators alone in our own arms... but in the meantime... lets get that bread.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE \\_ THE FIRST TRADE\\_ - PINS 5/15 - $26 STRIKE\n\nEdit - 4/24/4:01EST - good start - going to ride this sucker into next week - hope everyone has a great weekend!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nawf4pgt2su41.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7f7f6ffafb55297953ee846edd8e149e8fc69b0\n\nLove,\n\nSilk","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g78prm/silks_road_to_144k/"}
